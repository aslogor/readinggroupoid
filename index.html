<h2>About the Reading Group(oid)</h2>

<img class=rescenter src="logo_reading_groupoid.png" alt="Our logo" style="width: 55vw; max-width: 270px;">




<p>The Reading Groupoid is a weekly collective study session dedicated to the systematic exploration of Lie groupoids, Lie algebroids, and their profound connections to modern differential geometry and mathematical physics.</p>

<p>Our journey begins with a comprehensive study of Kirill C. H. Mackenzie's book <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107325883" target="_blank"><em>General Theory of Lie Groupoids and Lie Algebroids</em></a>, which provides the foundational framework for understanding these remarkable geometric structures. We shall proceed methodically through the theory, examining the intricate relationships between groupoids and algebroids, their cohomological properties, and the rich interplay between local and global perspectives.</p>

<p>A particular focus will be placed on the groundbreaking integrability theorem of <a href="https://doi.org/10.4007/annals.2003.157.575" target="_blank">Fernandes and Crainic</a>, which resolves the fundamental question of when a Lie algebroid can be integrated to a Lie groupoid. This result represents one of the most significant advances in the field and opens pathways to numerous applications across mathematics and theoretical physics.</p>

<h3>Future directions</h3>

Following our foundational studies, we shall explore different applications and extensions, including:

<ul>
	<li>Geometric mechanics and geometric integrators</li>
	<li>Pfaffian groupoids</li>
	<li>Orbifolds and singular foliations</li>
	<li>Morita equivalence and differentiable stacks</li>
</ul>


<h3>Format and participation</h3>

<p>Each weekly session features a detailed presentation by a rotating speaker, encouraging an environment of shared expertise and collaborative learning. The format encourages active participation, with ample opportunity for discussion, questions, and the exploration of connections to participants' own research interests.</p>

<p>The format will be hybrid, with the possibility to attend in person either in Madrid (at <a href="https://www.icmat.es/how-to-arrive/" target="_blank"> ICMAT</a>), in Warsaw (at <a href="https://www.impan.pl/en/" target="_blank">IMPAN</a>), or online. If you wish to attend online, please contact us.</p>

<h3>Who should attend</h3>

This reading group(oid) is ideal for:
<ul>
	<li>Researchers in differential geometry, mathematical physics, and related fields</li>
	<li>‚Å†Postgraduate students seeking to expand their geometric toolkit</li>
	<li>‚Å†Anyone with a solid background in differential geometry who wishes to explore the frontiers of groupoid theory</li>
</ul>
